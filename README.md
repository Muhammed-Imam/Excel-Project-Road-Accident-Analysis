## Project Overview
This project delves into the realm of road accident analysis, aiming to unravel trends, streamline operations, and offer actionable insights. Initially furnished with the Raw Data sheet, the dataset has been meticulously expanded with supplementary sheets and enriched features to augment its utility and depth of insights.

## Introduction to the Dataset
The dataset for road accidents serves as a treasure trove of information, capturing a wide array of incidents that have occurred on roadways. Each entry in the dataset represents a unique event, encompassing details such as the location, time, weather conditions, types of vehicles involved, and the severity of the accident.

This rich dataset enables us to explore and analyze various facets of road safety, shedding light on critical factors that contribute to accidents and their repercussions. By delving into this data, we aim to extract invaluable insights that can drive evidence-based decision-making, enhance safety measures, and ultimately reduce the frequency and severity of road accidents.

## Objectives
1. Trend Identification: Uncover patterns and trends in road accidents over time to understand factors contributing to accidents.
2. Root Cause Analysis: Identify primary reasons behind road accidents, such as speeding, weather conditions, or road infrastructure issues.
3. Location-based Insights: Analyze accident hotspots to prioritize resources and interventions for improving road safety.
4. Demographic Analysis: Explore how age, gender, and other demographic factors influence the occurrence and severity of accidents.
5. Seasonal Variations: Investigate how seasonal changes impact accident rates and severity, guiding targeted safety campaigns.

## Tools and Techniques Used
* Excel Functions: Used various excel functions to add columns.
* Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates and standardized formats.
* PivotTables and PivotCharts: For dynamic analysis and visualization.
* Data Visualization: Charts, slicers, and conditional formatting.

## Deliverables

     - Total Casualties with Accident Severity (Slight, Serious, Fatal)
     - Total Casualties with Vehical Type (The highest vehicle type in terms of number of casualties is Cars)

4. Monthly Trend Sheet:

   * Contains Total Casualties for each month of the years (2021 and 2022)

5. Road Type Sheet:

   * Contains Total Casualties with Road Type (Slip road, One way street, Roundabout, Dual carriageway, Single carriageway)

6. Tree Map Sheet:

   * Contains Total Casualties with Road Surface Conditions (Dry, Wet, Snow / Ice)

7. Doughnut Charts Sheet:

   * Contains Total Casualties with Urban or Rural Area and Light Condition (Daylight, Dark)
  
8. Data Analysis Sheet:

   * Contains All KPI's (Primary, Secondary)
     
9. Dashboard Sheet

## Conclusion 
In conclusion, the road accident analysis project has provided valuable insights into the dynamics of road safety and accident occurrence. Through comprehensive data exploration and analysis, we have uncovered significant trends, identified key risk factors, and gained a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to road accidents.
